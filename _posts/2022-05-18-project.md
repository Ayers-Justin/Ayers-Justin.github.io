A couple of projects I have been working on are SWRC and Osowiec.

The following is a sample run of the program SWRC, which is a rune crafting calculator designed to maximize the user's in game resources for the game Summoner's War. This iteration was done in Java, and has since been adapted to C# and will eventually be converted to Javascript.

The next screenshot is an early stage development screenshot of my work in Unity3D. I am creating a game called Osowiec, which is going to be a horror/suspense game that takes place in 1915, on the Eastern Front.
