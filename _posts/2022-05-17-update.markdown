Good afternoon to all my beautiful readers. This site is not dead. After taking a few courses in web design and web programming, I am ready to re-approach the design and build of this website. 

After gaining a significant amount of free time recently, I intend to do the following:

1. Create web application version of SWRC (yes, I am back in the game, and therefore must update the application. And what better way to do it than to build my portfolio?)

2. Create a page on this website to run SWRC from the comfort of my website! No need to download a program that your computer might flag as malware because it wasn't developed by Microsoft!
3. Create an about me page.
4. Create an updateable resume page right here on my website!
5. Create additional pages for other works I have done, such as my writing and creative designs.
6. Post more common updates about current projects.


This list is not ordered in the order in which I will do it, but the order in which it came to mind to be done.

This concludes my post for today, check back soon for more updates.
